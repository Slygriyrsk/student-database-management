        -   **Branch**: e.g., `Computer Science`
        -   **Class**: e.g., `2nd Year`
2.  **Show All Students**:

    -   Choose option `2` to display all student records.
3.  **Search for a Student**:

    -   Choose option `3`.
    -   Select the search criterion (registration number, name, or branch).
    -   Enter the search query. For example:
        -   If searching by name: `John Doe`
4.  **Update Student Information**:

    -   Choose option `4`.
    -   Enter the registration number of the student to be updated.
    -   Choose the field to update (name, branch, or class) and provide new information. For example:
        -   To update the branch: `Electrical Engineering`
5.  **Delete a Student**:

    -   Choose option `5`.
    -   Decide whether to delete a specific student or clear all records.
6.  **Save Data to File**:

    -   Choose option `6` to save all student records to `students.txt`.
7.  **Load Data from File**:

    -   Choose option `7` to load student records from `students.txt`.
8.  **Sort Students by Name**:

    -   Choose option `8` to sort students alphabetically by their names.
9.  **Filter Students by Branch**:

    -   Choose option `9` to display students from a specific branch.

### Example Code for Beginners

Here is a simplified example of how to use the `StudentDatabase` class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "student_database.h" // Assuming the class is declared in this header file

int main() {
    StudentDatabase db;

    // Load data from file
    db.loadFromFile("students.txt");

    // Add a new student
    db.add();

    // Show all students
    db.showAll();

    // Search for a student by name
    db.search();

    // Update a student's details
    db.update();

    // Delete a student
    db.deleteStudent();

    // Save data to file
    db.saveToFile("students.txt");

    // Sort students by name
    db.sortByName();

    // Filter students by branch
    db.filterByBranch();

    return 0;
}
```

📖 Detailed Explanation
-----------------------

1.  **Classes and Methods**:

    -   **`Student`**: Represents a student with attributes for name, registration number, branch, and class.
    -   **`StudentDatabase`**: Manages a collection of `Student` objects. Provides methods for adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting students.
2.  **Core Functions**:

    -   **`add()`**: Adds new student records.
    -   **`showAll()`**: Displays details of all students.
    -   **`search()`**: Finds and displays students based on the search criterion.
    -   **`update()`**: Updates student details by registration number.
    -   **`deleteStudent()`**: Removes students from the database.
    -   **`saveToFile()`**: Saves student records to a file.
    -   **`loadFromFile()`**: Loads student records from a file.

    -   **`filterByBranch()`**: Displays students from a specific branch.

❓ FAQ
-----

**Q1: How do I handle input errors?**

Ans: The code currently handles some basic input errors, but you can enhance it by adding more validation. For example, to ensure the registration number is not empty:

```cpp
bool isValidRegistrationNumber(const std::string& regNo) const {
    return !regNo.empty();
}
```

**Q2: What if the file operations fail?**

Ans: The program includes basic error handling for file operations. For example, when saving to a file:

```cpp
void saveToFile(const std::string& filename) const {
    try {
        std::ofstream file(filename);
        if (!file) throw std::runtime_error("Unable to open file for writing.");
        // Write data to file...
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
}
```

**Q3: How do I add more features to the application?**

Ans: To add new features, you can extend the `StudentDatabase` class. For example, to add a feature for calculating the average grade:

    1.  Add a `grade` attribute to the `Student` class.
    2.  Implement methods in `StudentDatabase` to handle this new attribute.

**Q4: Can I integrate this with a database?**

Ans: Yes, you can replace file operations with database operations for more advanced data management. Consider using SQLite or another database for persistence.

**Q5: How can I improve the user interface?**

Ans: You can enhance the user interface by adding error messages and confirmation prompts. For example:

```cpp
void showAll() const {
    if (students.empty()) {
        std::cout << "No student records available. 😢\n";
    } else {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < students.size(); ++i) {
            show(i);
        }
    }
}
```
